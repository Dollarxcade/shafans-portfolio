# Portfolio Starter

A minimal dark-theme portfolio template (purple accents) with pages for Home, Projects, Blog, Experience, and Contact.

## Run locally

1. Open the project folder in VS Code (or any code editor).
2. Run a simple static server (recommended):

- Using Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
- Or install the Live Server extension for VS Code and click "Go Live".

Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## How to update content

- Social links & site name: edit `assets/js/main.js` at the `siteConfig` object.
- Projects: edit `assets/data/projects.json` — add or edit objects. Each project expects: `id`, `title`, `date`, `tags`, `previewImage`, `headerImage`, `descriptionHtml`.
- Blog posts: edit `assets/data/blog.json` with the same structure as projects.
- Images: place images in `assets/images/` and reference them from the JSON files.

Description fields accept HTML (`descriptionHtml`) so you can include images or markup.

## File structure

- `index.html` — Home
- `projects.html` — Projects listing & filters
- `blog.html` — Posts listing
- `experience.html` — Experience page
- `contact.html` — Contact page
- `assets/css/styles.css` — core styles
- `assets/js/main.js` — site logic and data fetching
- `assets/data/*.json` — content data
- `assets/images/*` — placeholder images

## Next steps / suggestions

- Add your own images and replace the placeholders in `assets/images/`.
- Improve accessibility: add focus trapping for overlay and keyboard shortcuts.
- Deploy to GitHub Pages by pushing this repo and enabling Pages in the repo settings.
